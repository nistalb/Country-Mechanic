# Country-Mechanic
App to track maintenance of equipment used on hobby farms and rural homesteads.

# Concept
Rural living requires a large and diverse collection of equipment that needs maintenace to stay safe and effective.  Equipment includes cars, trucks, ATVs, and tractors, as well as tools with small engines like chainsaws and brush hogs.  For some equipment, maintenance is performed on a schedule, for others the maintenance is based on the hours of use or mileage and can therefore have inconsistent periods between maintenance activities.  In both of these cases it can be hard to remember all of the maintenance required or the steps required to perform the maintenance.  This is where Country Mechanic will come in.  The app will have a garage that stores all of the equipment that requires maintenance.  When a piece of equipment is selected from the garage the maintenance record, upcoming tasks, equipment informtion, and required consumables can be viewed.   

# User Story
The user will start on a home page where they can see information about Country Mechanic and choose to signup or login.  If it is the users first time on the site they can signup.  The signup will be a modal that collects user information.  Once user information is filled in and submitted the user will be taken to the Main page of the website.  The Main page contains the Garage as a sidebar and a viewing area for the equipment information.

A returning user will be able to login from the home page and will be taken to the Main page.

In the sidebar of the main page will be a list of all of the equipment that is being tracked with this app.  At the bottom of the sidebar will be a button to add more equipment.  Clicking this button will take the user to the add equipment form, see wireframes for a preview of the equipment form.  Once new equipment is added it will be viewable in the sidebar.

On first login the main viewing area will ask the user to add a piece of equipment to start the garage.   If there is equipment already in the garage then the main viewing area of the main page will show the piece of equipment that was edited most recently. 

The user can add tools, consumables, and tasks for the equipment currently showing in the viewing area by clicking links in the header.  Each link will navigate the user to a form to add the necessary information, see wireframes for views of forms.  Once the information is entered the user will be returned to the main page at whicever state they left it.  

If the user clicks one of the links in the viewing area (Maintenance Record, Upcoming Tasks, Misc Info, Consumables, Tasks, or Tools), the viewing are will change to reflect the data linked to by the link.   Maintenance records and Upcoming tasks will be read only.  For each other link the data will be a link to a show page for that piece of data.  Once on the show page the data can be edited.
