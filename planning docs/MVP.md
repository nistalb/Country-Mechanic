#  MVP for Country Mechanic

## Pitch
Country Mechanic will provide folks living in rural areas with a tool to facilitate management of the maintenance activities that are required for their myriad pieces of equipment.  Without this tool folks are using a paper and pen to write down the maintenance steps and timing for their tractors, atv's, chainsaws, cars, trucks, snowmobiles, brush hogs, pumps, generators, and on and on.  As you can imagine, with this system things get missed.  Beyond that, when it comes time to do maintenance, you may not have at hand the type of oil, or brand of filter, or size of chain required, and you just can't remember what you used last time.  So now it's research time.  Then you are in the middle of the task and you have forgotten a step, and it's back to research again.  Hassle!!

With Country Mechanic all of the information you need for any maintenance task is readily available in one place.  

In the initial rollout the product will have the following features:
* user registration and login - this will make sure you can keep your equipment list private
* secure storage of information on all pieces of equipment
* maintenance history tracking
* upcoming maintenace notification
* creation of tools in a database
* creation of consumable in a database
* list of required tools for each task
* list of consumables for each task
* time and cost for each task - this will help to decide if it's better to do the work yourself or hire out the work
* ability to embedd instructional youtube videos into tasks

Technology Stack
* Django SQL

Future versions of this product will add:
* a prepopulated database of common tools that can be added to tasks
* a prepopulated database of common consumables that can be added to tasks
* ability to purchase consumables or tools from the app by linking to Amazon, O'Reilly Auto Parts, Ace Hardware, or other vendors
* a forum for folks to ask questions about servicing pieces of equipment
* an Ask a Mechanic feature to chat with mechanics online
* craigslist like e-commerce for used equipment
